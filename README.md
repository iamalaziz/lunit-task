## About

This project is built to pass the Assignment Step in the interview process.

## Tasks

Make two components: Canvas & List

**Canvas:**
- The user can draw circles.
- The beginning and the end points of the circle should get connected to form a full circle.

**List:**
- Finished circle names are displayed in the List component.

**Circle Interaction:**
- If clicked inside a circle, it gets removed from the canvas.
- If two circles overlap, the one added last gets removed.
